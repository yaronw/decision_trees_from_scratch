# decision_trees_from_scratch
This code includes decision tree models implemented in Python from scratch.

There are three classification and four regression problems here.

The classifications are modeled with the C4.5 algorithm, which is capable of processing both categorical and continuous features and making a discrete prediction.

The regressions are modeled with the CART algorithm, which can also process categorical and numeric features and produces a continuous, numerical prediction.  This code base runs CART on datasets that have numerical features only.

Use this command to run the code:
```python project.py```
